## Web APIs:Timed Coding Quiz

## Task

As i proceed in the journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it’s likely that i will be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help become familiar with these tests and be given a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s task invites to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
